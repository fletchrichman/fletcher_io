    <strong>Igniting University Entrepreneurship – A Student Perspective</strong>
</p>
<p>
    My Sophomore year in college at CU Boulder, I became addicted to startups.
</p>
<p>
After one lucky email to Brad Bernthal, executive director of the    <a href="http://www.siliconflatirons.com/initiatives.php?id=entrep">Silicon Flatirons Entrepreneurship Initiative</a>, I was led down an incredible journey
that included participating in the <a href="http://cunvc.org/">New Venture Challenge,</a> joining awesome clubs like    <a href="http://startupcu.com/">StartupCU</a>and <a href="http://innovatecu.com/">InnovateCU</a>, teaching myself web development to start my first
    company, participating in the inaugural <a href="http://startupcolorado.com/startup-summer">Startup Summer</a> class, and landing an amazing internship
    with <a href="http://pivotdesk.com/">PivotDesk </a>right after they graduated from <a href="http://techstars.com/">TechStars</a>. On the way I attended
    some incredibly inspiring events hosted on and off campus – I was enthralled by the fact that brilliant, successful entrepreneurs would share all of their
stories and then respond to my questioning emails at midnight on a Saturday. I was motivated to improve the energy on campus and helped host the first ever<a href="http://www.tedxcu.com/">TEDxCU</a>, launch the <a href="http://nlab.colorado.edu/">nLab</a> weekly co-working sessions, and built a    <a href="http://www.startups2students.com/">jobs board for internships at startups</a>.
</p>
<p>
    In a few short years, I’ve gone from another wandering college student to an incredibly passionate young entrepreneur. You could say that my
    entrepreneurial “flame” has been ignited.
</p>
<p>
    I’ve also realized something profound: there is a massive unrealized potential at CU Boulder. Most students have no idea that they are just minutes away
    from one of the most active and exciting startup communities in the world, and often it feels like there is a massive gap between what is really just a 3
    minute bike ride. The number of students who “bridge the gap” between the two each year and are able to successfully make that transition is paltry
    considering there are 30,000 students milling around, partying, and whining about how they can’t get a job.
</p>
<p>
    I don’t think this problem exists because their aren’t enough programs at the school. Almost every program on campus is preaching cross-disciplinary
    innovation and entrepreneurship, and the number of student groups with an entrepreneurial flair is impressive and exciting. The problem exists because
    there is no central point of focus for these different programs and student entrepreneurs that also provides a connection to the Boulder startup community.
    There are many different paths for students to get hooked on startups, but not nearly as many resources once they do.
</p>
<p>
    I truly believe that the solution to this problem is space. Although CU’s campus is enormous and beautiful, space is scarce, and all of the university
    space is catered towards the classic lecturing style. By creating a open space that caters towards student collaboration, and filling it with the school’s
    most passionate young entrepreneurs, Spark Boulder will truly ignite all of the entrepreneurial energy I’ve seen at CU Boulder. By taking those student
    innovators and putting them together with all the student clubs, programs, and events, we will create a bridge between the school and one of the world’s
    greatest startup communities. It’s a very important piece to a goal that I’ve now heard many times and resonates with me: to become the number one public
    university for entrepreneurship.
</p>
<p>
    We can’t do this alone, we’re dependent on support from everyone in the university and startup communities. If you’re a community member interested in
    mentoring students, a student who wants to be in the space, an alum who wants to support us, or are just as excited about this as we are, please get in
    touch. Email sparkboulder@gmail.com, tweet @SparkBoulder, or send us some pigeon mail to our beautiful new home at 1310 College, Suite #100.
