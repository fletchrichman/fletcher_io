							<span class="post-meta"><span class="meta-date">June 2013</span>
							<p>
							    <strong>
							        <em>
							            This is a perspective on how and why to get involved as a student entrepreneur at CU Boulder through the themes of The Startup of You by Reid
							            Hoffman and Ben Casnocha. It is an amazing read and I highly recommend it.
							        </em>
							    </strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em> </em></strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    In today’s world, the skills and mindset of entrepreneurship are incredibly important for everyone, especially students. A college degree no longer
							    guarantees you a stable career. Developing entrepreneurial skills gives you a great advantage in finding a job or creating your own job.
							</p>
							<p>
							    At CU Boulder, you have an incredible opportunity to get experience and make connections in one of the best startup communities in the world. By
							    considering your life to be a startup that is in permanent beta, there are a clear set of steps you can follow to develop and improve yourself and your
							    future.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <em>Note: The general methods apply to any community around the world, but some of the local events and names are specific to Boulder.</em>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong>1. Develop a competitive advantage</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em>Why it’s important: </em></strong>
							    The first step is understanding yourself. You can start by understanding your assets, aspirations, and the market realities.
							</p>
							<ul>
							    <li>
							        <em>Assets</em>
							        include hard assets (money, physical possessions, etc) and soft assets (skills, experience, connections, etc.).
							    </li>
							    <li>
							        <em>Aspirations</em>
							        are defined by a simple but hard to answer question: Who and what do you want to be? That one question is something that many people are still trying
							        to find the answer to, so don’t worry if you don’t know yet.
							    </li>
							    <li>
							        <em>Market realities</em>
							        are what people will actually pay you for.
							    </li>
							</ul>
							<p>
							    Finding your competitive advantage is a constant re-evaluation process, and arguably the most important step.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em> </em></strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em>How I did it: </em></strong>
							    This is a step I’m still working on, and probably always will be. I’ve gone from a major in Environmental Engineering, to Electrical Engineering, to
							    Electrical and Computer Engineering, expanding and changing my competitive advantage each time. I have developed new assets to match my changing
							    aspirations, which are moving to fit to the market realities.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong>2. Plan to Adapt</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em>Why it’s important:</em> </strong>
							    It’s easy to just do the bare minimum of what it takes to get a degree, and not take advantage of the opportunities at college. Staying on track to
							    graduate in 4 (or 5) years is important, but you also need to be flexible about what you do while at school. You have a unique opportunity as a student to
							    try a wide range of student organizations, internships, and hobbies while at college. This is a great way to test your competitive advantage: find
							    experiences that match your aspirations and get involved. By prioritizing learning during these experiences, you can grow your soft assets to match your
							    aspirations. The best part about these experiences in college is that it’s easy to “pivot”, or change where you spend your time being involved. As a
							    student, there is no expectation of long-term commitment, which is a significant advantage in broadening your experiences.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em>How I did it: </em></strong>
							    As soon as I got to school, I started looking for ways to get involved. My freshmen year, I joined several student groups and got a part time internship. I
							    have pivoted multiple times between various student groups in energy, leadership, and entrepreneurship. I have also pivoted between internships in
							    government, large corporate world, and the startup world.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong>3. Build a Network</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em>Why it’s important:</em> </strong>
							    The people you know are one of your most valuable assets. People can help provide resources, information, and opportunities. The people you surround
							    yourself with are also a strong influence on who you become. By spending time with people who you want to be like, you can change yourself to get closer to
							    your aspirations.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em>How I did it: </em></strong>
							    The easiest way I saw to build my network was to use online tools. All of these services are free, and provided quick and easy ways to expand my network
							    and reinforce relationships.
							</p>
							<ul>
							    <li>
							        I set up a <a href="https://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a>, and forwarded all of my emails to it. This made email 1000 times easier and more efficient.
							    </li>
							    <li>
							        I created a <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, and followed all the groups and people I got involved with. Twitter is often an easy way to
							        reach out to other entrepreneurs, and is a great promotional tool.
							    </li>
							    <li>
							        I created a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>. LinkedIn is a powerful professional networking tool that allows for easy introductions,
							        and is valuable for understanding the history/background of people in your network. Add me as a connection if you want, I am happy to introduce you to
							        any of my connections.
							    </li>
							    <li>
							        I made an account on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a>. Meetup.com helps you find local events and groups in areas that interest you.
							        Boulder has an amazing variety of events.
							    </li>
							    <li>
							        I made an account on <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a>. This is an invaluable learning tool filled with a constantly growing knowledge base. I
							        followed people like Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia, and topics like Startups, Venture Capital, and everything else that interested me.
							    </li>
							</ul>
							<p>
							    <strong>4. Pursue Breakout Opportunities</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em>Why it’s important</em>: </strong>
							    To find and pursue breakout opportunities, the first key is curiosity. By exploring your areas of interest, you can tap into networks of opportunity and
							    better understand how you can contribute.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong> </strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em>How I did it</em>: </strong>
							    I see in-person events as the best way to satisfy my curiosity, help meet new people, stay in touch with previous connections, and keep up to date on
							    opportunities. I<strong> </strong>attend meetups, speaker series, and other entrepreneurial events as much as I can. Some of the most valuable events are
							    put on by:

							The culmination of almost every community event has been put together on event calendars on    <a href="http://www.boulderstartups.org/">BoulderStartups.org</a> and <a href="http://boulder.me/">Boulder.me</a>
							</p>
							<p>
							    I made a commitment to attend at least 1 event per week. It’s incredibly easy to find interesting events. I often have to pick and choose, there are so
							    many events I could probably just spend all my time attending them.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong></strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong>5. Take Intelligent Risk &amp; Tap Network Intelligence</strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong></strong>
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em>Why</em> it’s important:</strong>
							    Once you find opportunity, you need to take action on it. Although it may seem like a lot of risk, I encourage you to just go for it. Start a new
							    organization, build a prototype of your idea, or go do whatever you have always wanted. Once you get started, you have a chance to really utilize and
							    accelerate the network and the knowledge you have been building.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <strong><em>How I did it</em>: </strong>
							    I have found that pursuing the things I am passionate about leads to the highest likelihood of success. People can tell if you are genuine and passionate,
							    and it is inspirational. It makes people want to see you succeed. Being active as an entrepreneur also helps you “make your own luck.” Although many paths
							    to success seem like luck, you have to put yourself out there to get into those lucky situations. It’s hard to give broad advice on taking action, so here
							    are a few of the tactics I use to maximize network intelligence and generate more opportunities:
							</p>
							<p>
							    <em> </em>
							</p>
							<p>
							    · I use online tools to stay in touch with people I meet. When I meet someone, I try to get a business card or equivalent and follow up with a short email
							    and request to connect on LinkedIn. I also use the tools to reach out to people you do not yet know through Twitter, LinkedIn, or Quora.
							</p>
							<p>
							    · I seek out opportunities to connect like-minded people and groups when I recognize similarities or synergies. Just by knowing the people in your network,
							    I can create opportunity through a simple email or twitter introduction. This is an easy way to gain credibility and people’s trust/thanks.
							</p>
							<p>
							    · I follow and promote interesting new companies and organizations on Twitter. Early stage companies appreciate a mention, follow, or retweet. Twitter can
							    be used to give feedback, connect, for promotion, or in a variety of other ways, be creative.
							</p>
							<p>
							    · I follow the practice of “give before you get”. I try to give back and help others whenever I get the chance. At first you may feel like you can’t do
							    much, but people are often just looking for some feedback on their idea/product. By just taking a few minutes to try it out, you can provide them with an
							    incredibly valuable service and maybe some ideas to improve their own company. This practice applies to any situation, improves the community as a whole,
							    and will always come back to benefit you.
							</p>
							<p>
							    · I don’t pass up opportunities. I took on any challenge, big or small, until I was so busy that I had to prioritize.
							</p>
							<p>
							    <br/>
							    <em>
							        Note: These suggestions are very much opinions. They have worked well for me, but take them with a grain of salt because everyone has different
							        strengths and weaknesses and therefore needs different strategies.
							    </em>
							</p>
							<p>
							    And that’s it! As you may have noticed, none of these steps have an “end”. I just constantly iterate on these steps, and they seem to compliment each other
							    more and more.
							</p>
							<p>
							    Welcome to the community! The best part being in a startup community, especially for a student, is that everyone is willing to take their time to help you
							    out. Don’t be afraid to seek out someone you are interested in talking with for some coffee. You will be surprised at who will say yes (pretty much
							    everyone). Keep in mind that these are just the first three steps! What you do from here depends on what you are interested in, but could include starting
							    your own company, working at a startup, or maybe just being entrepreneurial in a big company. Whatever you do, it is important for you to focus on
							    opportunities that fit within your skillset and aspirations.
							</p>
							<p>
							    Questions or comments are very much appreciated, this is just my humble opinion of how to get started, I am sure there are plenty of other ways to do it.
